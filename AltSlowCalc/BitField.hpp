/*
   This is the backend of the Integer class. This class is an unsigned number
   expressed in binary. It handles all of the memory-management and a subset
   of operations that allow the Integer class to be cleaner, implementation-
   wise.

   It doesn't do alot of error checking, and will allow you to shoot yourself
   in the foot. You have been warned.

   So, BitField is like GMPs natural type, mpn. The only exception is that
   BitField does ALL memory management, so Integer doesn't have to worry about
   ANY of it.

   This originally started with each BitField having a private copy of its
   bit data, which was in an array that fit it perfectly. This incurred alot
   of unnecessary copying and reallocation. I decided to make it more like
   bc_num in GNU bc, and implemented COW. This makes the numerous temporary
   variables created by C++ more efficient. BitHolder holds a non-zero number
   in an array that may be larger than necessary.
