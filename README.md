# Calculators

I saw One Lone Coder's video about fixed-point numbers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMsrZvBmQnU), and I wanted to share some calculators that I have created that construct floating-point numbers from operations on `int`s and `char`s. I will fill this out later as I go through my garbage to find them.
